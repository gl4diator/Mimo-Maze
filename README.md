# Mimo-Maze
This is a maze/puzzle/logic and adventure game insipred by tutorials from internet named by me "Mimo Maze".

To open the application or game you need to install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing the python application you need to install some necessary modules in the command prompt console as an administrator with the command 'pip install'
1. pip install keyboard
2. pip install turtle
3. pip install winsound
4. pip install random

Some of modules probably are not necessary. I just listed them up "just in case".

Install the custom font from "font" directory for a properly and specific design. 

The application can be run with the command prompt: python.exe mimo.py (in the game directory)
